# Home Traveller 
Travelling can be costly, time-consuming, while tourism has become a big environmental threat. What if we become more conscious travellers by travelling from the comfort of our homes? This is what Home Traveller is all about. Just choose a country and let Home Traveller do all the work for you. 

While we understand the limitations of this approach to travelling, we found this project to be a great way to practice DOM manipulation and using APIs.
